## ASP.NET Core Web Application - MVC - ProductApp.Web

#### What is the MVC pattern?

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: 
Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using this pattern, 
user requests are routed to a Controller which is responsible for working with the Model to perform user actions 
and/or retrieve results of queries. The Controller chooses the View to display to the user, and provides it with any Model data it requires.

The following diagram shows the three main components and which ones reference the others:

#### What is ASP.NET Core MVC

The ASP.NET Core MVC framework is a lightweight, open source, highly testable presentation framework optimized for use with ASP.NET Core.

ASP.NET Core MVC provides a patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns. 
It gives you full control over markup, supports TDD-friendly development and uses the latest web standards.
